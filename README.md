# Truthset analysis - Haploid variant calling in Nanopore data
Benchmarking haploid variant identification accuracy of varaint callers.
This repository contains scripts, sequences and templates, for benchmarking haploid variant affienciency in MinION/GridION Nanopore reads.

##truthset composition
###Plasmid dataset
This truthset cointains chimeric plasmid mixtures in a controlled truth-set framework.

    A 261 bp insert region was selected (positions 2554â€“2785).

    The Delta spike plasmid (pUNO-01) was used as the base donor.

    Two chimeric plasmids were generated by replacing the 261 bp region with sequences from Wild-type and Omicron variants.

    Plasmid mixtures were prepared at varying ratios to generate ground-truth complexity.

Mixing Ratios

Due to pipetting precision limits at low concentrations, the final ratios represent empirically measured concentrations rather than theoretical values.
