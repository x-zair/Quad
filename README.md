## Truthset composition
### Plasmid dataset
Cointains chimeric plasmid mixtures in a controlled truth-set framework.

    - The Delta spike plasmid (pUNO-01) was used as the base donor (7179).
    - A 261 bp insert region was selected (positions 2554â€“2785).
    - Two chimeric plasmids were generated by replacing the 261 bp region with sequences from Wild-type and Omicron variants.
    - Plasmid mixtures were prepared at varying ratios to generate ground-truth complexity.
